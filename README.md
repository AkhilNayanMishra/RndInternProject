# R&D Intern Assessment (Partial Submission)

##  Important Scope Note

This submission **does not include the Android application**. Due to a 3-hour time limit and not having the Android Studio build environment (SDK/NDK) installed, I focused on completing the other core components of the assessment as **standalone modules** to demonstrate my skills in C++/OpenCV and TypeScript.

This project was built using **VS Code** and the **MSYS2/MINGW64** build environment for C++.

---

##  Features Implemented

### 1. Standalone C++ OpenCV Logic (Folder: `/cpp_logic`)

This module proves the core C++ requirement of the assessment.

* [x] **C++ Project:** A `main.cpp` file that builds with a standard C++ compiler (`g++`).
* [x] **OpenCV Usage:** Successfully loads a static image from disk (`cv::imread`).
* [x] **Core Algorithm:** Implements the required **Grayscale** (`cv::cvtColor`) and **Canny Edge Detection** (`cv::Canny`) logic, just as the assessment specified.
* [x] **Output:** Saves the processed image to disk (`cv::imwrite`) as `processed_output.png`.

### 2. TypeScript Web Viewer (Folder: `/web`)

This module proves the web requirement of the assessment.

* [x] **TypeScript Project:** A clean project setup with `tsconfig.json`, compiling `src/main.ts` into `dist/main.js`.
* [x] **DOM Updates:** The `main.ts` script successfully finds the `<img>` and `<span>` elements by their IDs and updates their content.
* [x] **Static Viewer:** The `index.html` page successfully loads and displays the `sample.png` (the output from the C++ module) and populates the mock data for "Resolution".

---

##  Features Omitted (Due to Environment)

The following components were omitted due to the 3-hour time constraint and the lack of an Android Studio build environment:

* **Android App:** No Android project, `MainActivity`, or `.apk` was built.
* **JNI (NDK):** No JNI bridge was created, as this requires the Android NDK.
* **OpenGL ES:** No `GLSurfaceView` or real-time rendering was implemented.

---

##  Output Sample

This is the `processed_output.png` file generated by the C++ module (`/cpp_logic/main.cpp`). This same image is used as `sample.png` in the web viewer.

## ⚙️ Setup & Run Instructions

### 1. C++ Module (`/cpp_logic`)

1.  Ensure you have an environment with `g++` and `opencv4` installed (e.g., MSYS2 MINGW64).
2.  Navigate to the `cpp_logic` folder.
3.  **Compile:** `g++ main.cpp -o processor.exe $(pkg-config --cflags --libs opencv4)`
4.  **Run:** `./processor.exe`
5.  **Output:** `processed_output.png` will be created in the folder.

### 2. Web Module (`/web`)

1.  Navigate to the `web` folder.
2.  **Install:** `npm install`
3.  **Compile:** `npx tsc` (This compiles `src/main.ts` to `dist/main.js`)
4.  **Run:** Open `index.html` in any web browser (e.g., using the "Live Server" VS Code extension).
